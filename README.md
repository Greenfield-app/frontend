# What's Eat - Helping you decide what to eat

## Goals
What's eat helps decide what to eat so you don't have to. The app contains all of your food preferences, keeps track of when you have eaten these foods, and will recommend to you what to eat 

## What's Eat - Front End

## Features

### Eat it or leave it

On this page, the app randomly displays a food to the user as well as nearby locations that serve the food and ratings. The user can either hit the eat button (eat it) to save the food to their history, or hit the delete button (leave it) if they're not interested.

### My Eats

For a logged in user, it will display their past eats. For a guest user, it will not show anything.
