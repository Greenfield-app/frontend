In CRUD terms, the front end UI will be able to:

C - create new food card 

R - read all food items in user database and display the food items in order of longest time since eaten to most recent

U - update a card by clicking eat button. This should move the card lower in the list

D - delete a card if you decide your sick of a certain food
