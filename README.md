# What's Eat - Helping you decide what to eat

## Goals
What's eat helps decide what to eat so you don't have to. The app contains all of your food preferences, keeps track of when you have eaten these foods, and will recommend to you what to eat 

## What's Eat - Front End
 This is the front end UI for What's eat. Below is the current design plan:

In CRUD terms, the front end UI will be able to:

C - create new food card 

R - read all food items in user database and display the food items in order of longest time since eaten to most recent

U - update a card by clicking eat button. This should move the card lower in the list

D - delete a card if you decide your sick of a certain food
