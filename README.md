# What's Eat - Helping you decide what to eat

## Goals
What's eat helps decide what to eat so you don't have to. The app contains all of your food preferences, keeps track of when you have eaten these foods, and will recommend to you what to eat 

## What's Eat - Front End
 This is the front end UI for What's Eat.
